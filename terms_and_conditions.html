                                                us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or

                                          <h2>Governing Law</h2>

                                          <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
                                                Karnataka, India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                                          <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
                                                considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is
                                                held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions
                                                of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                                                agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace
                                                any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

                                          <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these
                                                Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at
                                                least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
                                                constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become
                                                effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not
                                                agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
